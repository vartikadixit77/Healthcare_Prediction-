# Healthcare_Prediction- Project Overview
The Healthcare Prediction of Diabetes project is designed to leverage machine learning and statistical analysis to predict the likelihood of diabetes in individuals based on various health parameters. The goal is to provide a tool that assists healthcare professionals in early detection and diagnosis, ultimately contributing to better patient outcomes.

Key Features
Data Preprocessing: Handling missing values, data normalization, and feature selection.
Machine Learning Models: Implementation of various ML algorithms like Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest, and others for prediction.
Visualization: Graphical representation of data insights and model performance.
Evaluation Metrics: Use of accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC to measure model performance.
Technologies Used
Programming Language: Python
Libraries and Frameworks:
Data Analysis: pandas, numpy
Visualization: matplotlib, seaborn
Machine Learning: scikit-learn
Development Tools:
Jupyter Notebook or any Python IDE
Git for version control
Installation
Clone the repository:
bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/your-username/healthcare-prediction-diabetes.git
Navigate to the project directory:
bash
Copy code
cd healthcare-prediction-diabetes
Create and activate a virtual environment (optional but recommended):
bash
Copy code
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `venv\Scripts\activate`
Install dependencies:
bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Usage
Prepare the dataset by placing it in the appropriate directory (data/ by default).
Run the Jupyter Notebook or Python script for data preprocessing and model training:
bash
Copy code
jupyter notebook
Open the diabetes_prediction.ipynb file and follow the instructions.
Evaluate the model using the test dataset and visualize the results.
Use the trained model to predict diabetes for new data.
Dataset
The project uses publicly available diabetes datasets, such as the PIMA Indian Diabetes Dataset, or a custom dataset provided by the user. Ensure the dataset has the following attributes:

Age
BMI
Glucose Level
Blood Pressure
Insulin Levels
Diabetes Pedigree Function
Other relevant health parameters
